      <h2>Directions:</h2>
      <h3>DOUGH</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Pulse flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor just to combine. Add
          butter and pulse until most of the butter is pea-size with some larger
          pieces throughout. Drizzle vinegar and ⅓ cup ice water over and pulse,
          scraping down sides once, just until dough comes together in clumps
          and there are no large pockets of flour. (Alternatively, whisk flour,
          sugar, and salt in a large bowl and use a pastry cutter to work in
          butter, then mix in vinegar and water with a rubber spatula.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer dough clumps to a clean work surface. Using a bench scraper,
          bring dough together (it will still look quite sandy and you might be
          tempted to add more water—don’t!) and gently pat into a 1"-thick
          rectangle. Using bench scraper, fold dough in half, then gently pat
          down again into a 1"-thick rectangle. Fold and pat down dough 2 more
          times (it should be fairly smooth at this point). Divide dough in
          half, flatten into disks, and wrap each tightly in plastic. Chill at
          least 2 hours and up to 3 days.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>FILLING AND ASSEMBLY</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Let 1 disk of dough sit at room temperature 5 minutes to slightly
          soften. Roll dough on a floured surface to a 12"-diameter round.
          Transfer dough to pie dish; lift up edges and allow dough to slump
          down into dish. Trim, leaving about 1" overhang. Chill while you
          prepare the filling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gently toss peaches, cornstarch, lemon juice, brandy (if using),
          vanilla extract, orange zest, salt, nutmeg, ⅔ cup (133 g) sugar, and 1
          Tbsp. flour in a large bowl to coat; set filling aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Roll second disk of dough on a floured surface to a 12"-diameter
          round. Scrape reserved filling, including juices, into pie crust; dot
          filling with butter. Top with remaining dough round then press crust
          edges together and fold over to seal; crimp edges.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place pie on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and chill in freezer 20
          minutes (this helps the crust to become extra flaky).
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 400°.</li>
        <li>
          Beat egg with 1 Tbsp. water in a small bowl. Mix cinnamon and
          remaining 2 Tbsp. sugar in another small bowl. Brush pie crust with
          egg wash, then sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Cut slits in top of crust
          to make a large X.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake pie on baking sheet 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350°
          and continue to bake pie, tenting with foil halfway through if crust
          is browning too quickly, until juices are thickened and bubbling in
          the center and crust is deep golden brown (check bottom if you can),
          about 1½ hours. Transfer pie to a wire rack and let cool at least 3
          hours before serving.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve slices of pie with scoops of vanilla ice cream if desired.
        </li>
      </ol>

				Do ahead: Pie can be baked 3 days ahead. Cover tightly and chill.
